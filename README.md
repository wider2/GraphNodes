Implemented on DotNet Core C# 2.0

but actually it is just a pure C# class method taking predefined graph as List<Tuple<int, int>> as input
 and returning all the paths between two predefined nodes as output.

For example, when asking it between nodes 1 and 4 from the sample data above,
program should return [1,2,4], [1,3,4]
